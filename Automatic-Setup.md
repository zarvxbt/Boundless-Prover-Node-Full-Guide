# Boundless Script Automatic Installation Guide

## What to Do Before Starting:

1. Create a new wallet.  
   Send **5 USDC (test token)** and **1-2 USD worth of Sepolia ETH** to the Base Sepolia network.

2. Follow the steps below to get the test tokens:

   - Get test USDC from https://faucet.circle.com  
   - Bridge Sepolia ETH to Base Sepolia using https://superbridge.app/base-sepolia

3. Get Base Sepolia RPC from the site below:  
   ‚Üí Go to https://dashboard.blockpi.io and register.  
   ‚Üí Register for free and create a "Base-Sepolia" endpoint.  

üìå These amounts and steps are valid for all networks.  
You can apply the same steps for Base Mainnet, Ethereum Sepolia, or other supported networks.

## Choosing a Template and Renting a Server on Vast.ai

To run the Boundless node, you need to rent a suitable server. Follow these steps:

1. Log into the Vast panel and click the **Templates** tab in the upper left.

2. From the list, select the **Ubuntu 22.04 VM** template.

3. From the top menu, select a GPU: **RTX 3090** or **RTX 4090** is recommended.

   > It may work on lower systems, but performance will decrease.

4. Set storage between **150-200 GB SSD**. (NVMe recommended)

5. From the top-left sorting menu, select **Price (inc)**.

   > This way, the best price/performance options will be listed at the top.

### Useful Commands:

1. Stop the Node:
```bash
just broker down
```

2. Restart the Node:
```bash
just broker up
```

3. Access broker.toml:
```bash
nano broker.toml
```

---

### Common Issues:

If you've configured your private key and RPC but you're seeing "WARN" logs, you need to activate your `.env` file:

```bash
just broker down
```
```bash
source .env.base-sepolia #adjust the ending depending on the network you're using
```
```bash
just broker
```

# Broker.toml Configuration Guide for RTX 4090

### Aggressive Configuration:
```toml
[prover]
mcycle_price = "0.0000000000002" 
peak_prove_khz = 500 
max_mcycle_limit = 25000
min_deadline = 180
max_concurrent_proofs = 2
lockin_priority_gas = 50000000000
```

### Balanced Configuration:
```toml
[prover]
mcycle_price = "0.000000000001"
peak_prove_khz = 420
max_mcycle_limit = 15000
min_deadline = 240
max_concurrent_proofs = 1
lockin_priority_gas = 25000000000
```

## Explanation of Settings:

- **mcycle_price**: The fee per task. The lower you set it, the more orders you can receive.
- **peak_prove_khz**: The number of operations your GPU can perform per second. (If problems arise, lower it or run a benchmark test.)
- **max_mcycle_limit**: Represents the maximum job size you'll accept.
- **min_deadline**: Minimum time to complete a task (for safety).
- **max_concurrent_proofs**: Number of tasks processed simultaneously. (Don‚Äôt go above 2.)
- **lockin_priority_gas**: The commission you‚Äôre willing to pay to grab a job (higher gwei = better chance to get orders)

Competition is high, and you may need to tweak these settings. Test each setting for at least 2 hours before changing again.
